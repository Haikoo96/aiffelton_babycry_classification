## **EDA**
1. General EDA
    - Sampling Rate, Duration by each class
2. Detail EDA
    - weighted average pitch(frequency range roughly determined), average number of harmonics, average magnitudes

## **Notice**
1. The Detail EDA was originally done only for SET 3 to find the bandwidth needed for the BandPass filter but was conducted on SET 1 and SET 2 for comparison.
